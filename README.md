## Data Management Systems

A [Data Management System (DMS)][dms] is a _framework_. It can be used to create a variety of _solutions_ such as [Data Portals][], [Data Catalogs][], [Data Lakes][] (or Data Meshes) etc. We have developed two DMS stacks that share a set of underlying core components:

- [CKAN][]: the open source data management system we created in 2007 and that we continue to develop and maintain. The main information on CKAN is at https://ckan.org/. Here we have some specific notes on how we develop and deploy CKAN as well as our thoughts on the [next generation of CKAN (v3)][v3].
- [DataHub][]: a simpler version of CKAN focused on SaaS platform at DataHub.io. DataHub and CKAN v3 share many of the same core components.
