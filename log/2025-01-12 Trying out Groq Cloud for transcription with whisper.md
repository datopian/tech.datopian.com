# Trying out Groq Cloud for transcription with whisper

https://console.groq.com/

It's free (up to 7.2k minutes and 20 requests). Max 40Mb file. Lots of formats.

Just upload and go. Pretty simple. Outputs full transcript.

I find this useful as chatgpt seems to struggle to transcribe recordings that I upload (maybe someone has tips on how to do this).
