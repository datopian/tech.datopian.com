# Notebook

Our lab notebook. Our informal thoughts. Our very raw blog.

`Project` should be the primary object in a DataHub/Data Portal -- not Dataset.

Why? Because actually this is more than a Dataset. For example, it includes issues or workflows. A project is a good name for this that is both generic and specific.

cf Git-hub e.g. Gitlab (and Github). Gitlab came later and did this right: it's primary object is a Project which hasA Repository. Github still insits on calling them repositories (see primary menu item which is "Create a new repository"). This is weird, a github "repository" isn't actually a github repository: it has issues, stats, workflows and even a discussion board now. Calling it a project is the accurate description and the repository label is a historical artifact when that was all it was. I sometimes create "repos" on Github just to have an issue tracker. Gitlab understands this and actually allows me to have projects without any associated repository.

TODO: take a screenshot to illustrate Gitlab and Github.
