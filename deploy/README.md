# Deploy To CKAN Cloud

As a developer you will need to create new instance and deploy to Datopian servers. CKAN portals hosted by Datopian are living on Google Cloud Platform run by Kubernetes engine.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have access to [Datopian Jenkins](https://cc-p-jenkins.ckan.io/) account
- Make sure you have write permissions to [Datopian Gitlab account](https://gitlab.com/viderum)

::: tip
Please contact devops@datopian.com if you donâ€™t have access to the Jenkins account or permissions to create new project on GitLab.

## Creating CKAN Portal - Deploying for first time

In order to deploy CKAN portal on Kubernetes cluster, you will need to first dockerize the CKAN application. For that you will need:

- `Dockerfile` to build an image.
- `.env` file To keep environment variables for an image.
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` To deploy an image to container registry.

Later Kubernetes will pull that image and build a portal using it.

We keep those file in private Gitlab Repositories.

Create new project in Gitlab:

- Navigate to https://gitlab.com/viderum
- Click "New Project" Button on the right
- Let's name it `cloud-deploy-demo-exercise`
  - We use following name convention: `cloud-[project-id]`
- Click "Create Project"

You should be able to see empty repository on https://gitlab.com/viderum/cloud-deploy-demo-exercise. Let's now add necessary files.

### Create Dockerfile

`Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Usually all you need is to copy `Dockerfile` from the existing project and modify per your needs.

- Click on "Add File" Button
- Copy everything from https://gitlab.com/viderum/cloud-deploy-demo/blob/master/Dockerfile and paste there
- Name the file `Dockerfile`
- Click "Commit Changes" Button

### Create .env file

Some of the CKAN configuration options can be defined as Environment variables on the server operating system. We keep this variables in `.env` file.

- Click `+` and choose "Add File"
- Copy everything from https://gitlab.com/viderum/cloud-deploy-demo/blob/master/.env
- Name the file `.env`
- Click "Commit Changes" Button

### Create .gitlab-ci.yml

`.gitlab-ci.yml` is responsible for running continuous deployments. It builds the newest image of portal and pushes to Gitlab registry. To create it:

- got to https://cc-p-jenkins.ckan.io/job/Initialize%20Gitlab/
- Click `Build with Parameters` button
- Change `viderum/cloud-instance-id` to `viderum/cloud-deploy-demo-exercise`
- Click `Build` button

At this point you should have all 3 files in your repository.

Wait until the Gitlab Build is successful.

Green means build was successful and our image was deployed to Gitlab Container registry. That means we are ready to create new instance on K8 cluster. :rocket:

### Create Instance

Now we need to deploy the new image to CKAN Cloud

- Go to https://cc-p-jenkins.ckan.io/job/create%20new%20instance/
- Click `Build With Parameters` Button
- Update `INSTANCE_ID` and `GITLAB_REPO` inputs per your needs
- Click `Build` Button

Wait until build is successful. Once done, that's it! Our instance is deployed to K8 cluster. Now let's create a route for it.

### Create route

We need now to create the route for your portal so that it's publicly accessible.

- Go to https://cc-p-jenkins.ckan.io/job/create%20route
- Click `Build With Parameters` Button
- Update `EXTRA_ARGS` with following: `instances-default deploy-demo-exercise deploy-demo-exercise`
- Set `DRY_RUN` to `no`
- Click `Build` button

### Check it is working

That's It! :fireworks: You should now be able to visit https://deploy-demo-exercise.ckan.io and see the live portal.
