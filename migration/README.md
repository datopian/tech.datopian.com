# Migration off CKAN-Cloud

This section includes guides for migration off Ckan-Cloud from datopian servers. We offer 2 different ways of doing this - [ckan cloud docker](https://github.com/ViderumGlobal/ckan-cloud-docker/) for simple setups and Kubernetes setup with [ckan cloud operator](https://github.com/datopian/ckan-cloud-operator/) for more complexed use cases.

## Guides
