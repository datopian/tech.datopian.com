# CKAN Enterprise

CKAN Enterprise is our name for what we hope would become our standard "base" distribution for CKAN going forward. It consists of the following:

* CKAN 2.8 + dependencies
* CKAN v3 blob storage following https://tech.datopian.com/blob-storage/#ckan-3-next-gen
  * https://github.com/datopian/giftless
  * https://github.com/datopian/ckanext-external-storage
  * https://github.com/datopian/ckanext-authz-service

At some point soon it would also include AirCan setup (instead of DataPusher) but this is not yet there yet as of Nov 2020.

[Future] We would also want it be easy to add common other features e.g.

* Harvesting
* ...
