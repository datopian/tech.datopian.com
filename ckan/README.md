# Getting Started: CKAN Classic

Here you'll learn how to install and run CKAN on your local machine. In the end, you can play with it importing and visualising data.

## Prerequisites

As CKAN stack is not simple we opted for standardizing our instructions with Docker Compose, which will help you spin up every service in a few commands.

If you already have Docker-compose, you are up to go! If not, please, follow instructions on [how to install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

On Ubuntu you can run:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-compose
```
