## Data Management Systems

[Data Management Systems (DMS)][dms] is a *system* or *framework*. It is a core technology and can be used to create a variety of *solutions* such as Data Portals, Data Catalogs etc.

We have two related DMS stacks:

* [CKAN][] is the open source data management system we created in 2007 and that we continue to develop and maintain. The main information on CKAN is at https://ckan.org/. Here we have some specific notes on how we develop and deploy CKAN as well as our thoughts on the next generation of CKAN (v3).
  * [Vision for CKAN v3 (next gen)][v3]
* [DataHub][] -- DataHub represents our vision for a next generation of CKAN and powers DataHub.io. DataHub and CKAN v3 share many of the same core components.

### Applications

You can use a DMS to build many kinds of specific applications:

* [Data Portals][portals] are gateways to data. That gateway can be big or small, open or restricted. For example, data.gov is open to everyone, whilst an enterprise "intra" data portal is restricted to its personnel.
* Data Catalog -- for now see https://ckan.org/

### Features

A DMS has a variety of features. This section provides an overview and links to specific feature pages that include details of how they work in CKAN and CKAN v3 / DataHub.

There are many ways to break down features and this is just one framing. We are thinking about others and if you have thoughts please get in touch.
