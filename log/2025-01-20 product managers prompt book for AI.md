> Martin Slaney's Product Managers Prompt Book as an example. He provides an entire library of prompts to assist with conducting competitor analysis, creating user stories, acceptance criteria, release notes, product visions you name it. After trying some of the prompt he suggested myself using the acceptance criteria creation as an example. I was blown away with how thorough it was and admittedly I wouldn't have come up with such a robust set of acceptance criteria myself.
